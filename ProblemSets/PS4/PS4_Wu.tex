\maketitle


I am interesting in data source about the population of players for certain PC or video games. 

Game industry is increasing rapidly along with technology development. From "Super Mario" to "PUBG"(Most popular PC online game in 2017, over 1.5 million average players online in February 2018), I have seen game's quality and quantity explosive increased in past 25 years, and the population growth of game player is huge today. 

I believe the "virtual world" will change human's life in the future.
