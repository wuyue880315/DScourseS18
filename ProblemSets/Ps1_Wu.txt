\section{Summary}

In order to make decisions, data studying and analysis are accurate and reliable. I am interested in how to make best decisions through data analysis. 

Through the courses I have taken, I learned programming and research skills. My expectation for this class is apply economic knowledge into the real society, and improve my programming skills.

Buying a house is the main target of most middle class people live in urban area, so the housing price would  significant affects people life quality. I have made a simple model to predict the housing price in certain city. In this class, I expect to develop my model further and generalized the model to different cities.

After graduation, I will apply for Economic PHD program in OU. I love economics, and I would spend all my life on solving Economics problems.
