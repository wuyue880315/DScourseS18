\maketitle

The first data I got without API is about the 20 most popular games in 2017 and the companies were made. 
From this data, I can make targets that the games I should study on. There are questions about those game I interest in:

1. What type of those games are?

2. Who are playing those game? (Age, Gender, Salary etc.)

3. Are those game similar to any previous games?

This data also include companies who made those games, and those companies are successful in the game market.
I also have intense to study those companies.

1. What size of those companies?

2. Why people like their games?

3. How do they manage their employee?

There were some unnecessary data in the vector, Google told me how to remove them.

The second data i got with API is about the most popular games show on Twitch TV. I found that the top popular games are "PVP" games, which means instead of killing monsters, people are fighting each other in those games. I am interest in why people like to watch people play "PVP" games. 

I used "httr", "jsonlite" and "lubridata" packages in this section.
